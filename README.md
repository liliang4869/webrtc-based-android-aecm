webrtc-based-android-aecm
=========================

  Java API for android acoustic echo cancellation.
  
  I already tested and using it on a LAN demo several monthes ago, it worked well most of the time but sometimes with little squeal, I know there must have something todo to make it better.
To make it better
=========================
  1. Maybe I should build the whole VOE and using the C++ interface proveded by apm? I'll try this later. 
  2. The API is a low level one, most of them are just wrappers of native WebRTC aecm interface. We should handle so many things by ourselves, like estimate the echo tailï¼Œhandle capture/render threads etc. I'm planning to provide a higher level of the API, which can handle those things for us automatically.

TODO List
=========================
  1. Build the apm interface.
  2. Provide a higher level of the API.
  3. Provide a VoIP demo to show how to use this API instead of doing AECM on PCM files.

Delaytime is different between different devices and situations
When call aecm,pay attention to the format of the audio data you r using.
